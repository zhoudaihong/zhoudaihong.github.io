    <!-- Dr. Zhou’s research focuses on <strong><u>intelligent software development</u></strong>, <strong><u>software quality assurance</u></strong>, and <strong><u>robotics software engineering</u></strong>. His primary interest lies in applying intelligent technologies, such as large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs), to solve multi-dimensional data analysis challenges in software engineering / robotic system, enhancing intelligent development and quality assurance. -->
    Dr. Zhou's research centers on <strong><u>AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE)</u></strong>, <strong><u>Embodied AI Robot (EAIR)</u></strong> and <strong><u>Robot Software Security</u></strong>, with a focus on <u>Software Data Analysis and Mining</u>, <u>Robotics Vulnerability Analysis</u>, <u>Intelligent Robot Software Development</u> and <u>Embodied Large Model</u>. He investigates the application of these techniques in both traditional and robotics software systems, leveraging advanced AI methods—such as large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs)—to enhance development efficiency, software quality, software security, and system reliability. Additionally, he explores the integration of LLMs and vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance automation in intelligent robot systems. His work focuses on integrating software engineering principles with AI technologies to develop intelligent, reliable, and autonomous systems.
