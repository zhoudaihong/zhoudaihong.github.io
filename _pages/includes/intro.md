Dr. Daihong Zhou (周代宏) is presently serving as an lecturer at the School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Shanghai Institute of Technology, China. Prior to that, he studied in the Software Engineering Lab at Fudan University. In January 2024, he received his Ph.D. in Software Engineering from Fudan University, under the supervision of Professor [Xin Peng](http://cspengxin.github.io) and Professor Yijian Wu.

Dr. Zhou’s research focuses on software data analysis and mining, program analysis, code LLM, and technical debt. His primary interest lies in leveraging advanced data mining techniques, such as large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs), to solve multi-dimensional data analysis problems in software engineering, thereby assisting software development and maintenance.

<p><strong>Collaboration Invitation:</strong> Dr. Zhou is open to collaborating with professors, researchers, and industry professionals who share similar research interests or have relevant projects. If you are interested in exploring opportunities for teamwork, please don't hesitate to reach out via email at <a href="dhzhou17@fudan.edu.cn">link</a> for potential collaborations.</p>
