    <!-- Dr. Zhou’s research focuses on <strong><u>intelligent software development</u></strong>, <strong><u>software quality assurance</u></strong>, and <strong><u>robotics software engineering</u></strong>. His primary interest lies in applying intelligent technologies, such as large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs), to solve multi-dimensional data analysis challenges in software engineering / robotic system, enhancing intelligent development and quality assurance. -->
    Dr. Zhou's research focuses on <strong><u>AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE)</u></strong>, <strong><u>Robotics Software Engineering (RoSE)</u></strong>, and <strong><u>Software Security</u></strong>, with a particular emphasis on areas such as <u>OSS Vulnerability Detection</u>, <u>Robotics Vulnerability Analysis</u>, <u>Software Repository Mining</u>, and <u>Technical debt</u>, among others. He explores the application of these concepts in both traditional software systems and robotics software systems. Dr. Zhou investigates how advanced AI techniques, such as large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs), can enhance development efficiency, software quality, software security, and system reliability. In addition, he addresses challenges in robotic motion control and planning, leveraging LLMs and vision-language models (VLMs) to improve robotic automation. His goal is to integrate software engineering principles with AI technologies to drive the development of intelligent, reliable, and autonomous systems.
